By accessing or using Mila Collective, you accept and agree to our website policies, including these Terms of Use, and you certify to us that (a) you are eighteen (18) years of age or older, and are at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction, (b) you have the legal capacity to enter into and agree to these Terms of Use, (c) you are using Mila Collective freely, voluntarily, willingly, and for your own personal enjoyment, and (d) you will only provide accurate and complete information to us and promptly update this information as necessary to maintain its accuracy and completeness.</p>

You agree that we have this unilateral right, and that all modifications or changes are in force and enforceable immediately upon posting. The updated version supersedes any prior versions immediately upon posting, and the prior version is of no continuing legal effect unless the revised version specifically refers to the prior version and keeps the prior version or portions thereof in effect.

You agree to re-visit this page on a frequent basis, and to use the “Refresh” or “Clear Cache” function on your browser when doing so. You agree to note the date above. If the “Last Updated” date remains unchanged from the last time you reviewed these Terms of Use, then you may presume that nothing in these Terms of Use has changed since the last time you visited. If the “Last Updated” date has changed, then you must review the updated Terms of Use in their entirety. You must agree to any updated Terms of Use or immediately cease use of Mila Collective. If you fail to review these Terms of Use as required to determine if any changes have been made, you assume all responsibility for such omission, and you agree that such failure amounts to your affirmative waiver of your right to review the updated terms.
